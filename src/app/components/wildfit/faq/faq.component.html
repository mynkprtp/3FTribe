  <h3>WILDFIT FAQs</h3>
    <div class="faq-content">
        <p><b>IS THIS A DIET? WHAT IF I DID KETO AND PALEO ALREADY?</b></p>
        <p>
          There are many similarities between some WILDFIT seasons and the Paleo
          Diet and the Keto Diet. However, what distinguishes WILDFIT is the
          enormous emphasis we place on mindset and behavioural change. Instead of
          just telling you what to eat, we give you the tools to rewire your
          thoughts (and therefore, your actions) around food, alcohol, caffeine,
          and much more. If you have experience in doing Keto / Paleo before, you
          could find yourself in a better position to understand the concepts of
          seasons! So all the more reason to try WILDFIT!!
        </p>
        <p><b>WHAT IS YOUR REFUND POLICY?</b></p>
        <p>
          We believe so firmly in WILDFIT that we’re proud to offer a 100%
          Satisfaction Guarantee. If you complete at least 95% of the program and
          you were not pleased with your experience, and did not experience any
          progress we’ll gladly offer you a full refund, no questions asked!
        </p>
        <p><b>IS WILDFIT SUITABLE FOR VEGETARIANS AND VEGANS?</b></p>
        <p>
          Yes, you can definitely still do WILDFIT and experience the various
          health benefits that come with it. But just keep in mind that the
          WILDFIT approach will recommend certain animal-based foods at certain
          parts of the 90-day program, which you can substitute with other
          plant-based foods that align with your dietary choices. The guidance
          around substitutions will be provided!

            >WHAT KIND OF WEIGHT OR HEALTH LEVEL SHOULD I CURRENTLY BE AT TO
            BENEFIT FROM WILDFIT?
          </b>
        </p>
        <p>
          It doesn’t matter where you’re at now - because WILDFIT is designed to
          meet you there, and take you where you need to be. Our students range
          from people with severe health issues to high-performance athletes. Many
          come to us with a variety of goals including weight loss, weight gain,
          more energy, symptom reduction, better sleep, levels of intimacy and
          fertility, and even an overall desire to feel better and have more
          energy.  Also, 96% of people who start WILDFIT, finish it. Which further
          proves that it’s suitable and effective for anyone at any fitness or
          weight level.
        </p>
        <p><b>WILL I NEED TO EXERCISE WHILE ON WILDFIT?</b></p>
        <p>
          No. One of the biggest myths in health and fitness is the idea that you
          need to exercise to get healthy. But the truth is, science has shown
          that 95% of your body shape is determined by your diet, and only 5% is
          determined by your physical activity.  However, one of the best
          side-effects of going on the WILDFIT program is that you will likely
          experience spikes in energy and you may actually feel like wanting to
          exercise. But this is not a necessary aspect of the program.
        </p>
        <p><b>WILL WILDFIT GET RID OF DISEASES?</b></p>
        <p>
          WILDFIT is not a medical program and should not be taken as medical
          advice. While clients have reported normalized blood sugar, disappearing
          allergies, healthy weight loss, and a dramatic reduction of various
          symptoms, these are simply side effects of living a better lifestyle.
          While many clients have eliminated various symptoms and ailments - and
          reduced their dependency on medication - we suggest that before making
          any major changes to your health-care plans (including medication
          dosage) you should consult your medical practitioner.
        </p>
        <p><b>HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO SEE RESULTS?</b></p>
        <p>
          There have been clients who see results well before program completion.
          Not everyone will experience the same, but it's possible. And it also
          depends on how willing you are in terms of allowing that change to
          happen. But overall, we're confident to say that in as little as 30
          days, you will experience radical shifts in your weight, energy, libido,
          sleeping patterns and overall happiness levels. If you're sceptical, try
          this program anyway: because you have 30 days to prove your sceptic mind
          wrong. Eric Edmeades so far has not had a case where his clients have
          asked for a refund. The program's completion rate is over 90%, which
          leaves us confident that it's almost impossible to not see any results
          with the WILDFIT program.
        </p>
        <p><b>CAN WILDFIT HELP ME WITH MY MENTAL AND EMOTIONAL WELLBEING?</b></p>
        <p>
          Yes, It will help you. You are what you eat. You eat because you are
          stressed and you are stressed because you eat. Food has effects on not
          just your physical body but your mental health as well.
        </p>

            >WILL THIS PROGRAM WORK FOR ME, EVEN IF NORMAL DIETS DIDN’T IN THE
            PAST?</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Above all else, the WILDFIT program is based on one scientific fact:
          it’s both infuriatingly hard, and unnecessary to try to improve your
          health through conventional diet and exercise programs. Statistics even
          show that the average American actually gains 3 lbs for every diet
          program they try. Because these traditional diets are designed by people
          who don't approach health problems holistically. On the contrary, the
          WILDFIT program is based on the principle that ‘every living thing has a
          natural diet’ and that the degree to which a species can stay on that
          diet is the same degree to which it will experience health and
          longevity.  WILDFIT draws heavily from evolutionary history, nutritional
          anthropology and modern-day hunter-gatherer communities to map out the
          perfectly natural human diet. When this is combined with the powerful
          science of behavioural psychology, it makes for a body transformation
          program that’s more permanently effective than anything else out there.
           So yes, we’re confident that WILDFIT will do wonders for your body and
          overall wellbeing - no matter your past experiences with weight loss or
          healing.
        </p>
        <p><b>I’M ALLERGIC TO CERTAIN TYPES OF FOOD. CAN WILDFIT HELP ME?</b></p>
        <p>
          We highly recommend you first consult your doctor regarding any food
          allergies you may think you have. If you indeed have any confirmed
          allergies to any of the foods recommended in the WILDFIT program, please
          avoid them.  With that said, the WILDFIT program is not a
          hyper-restrictive diet where you’ll be limited to a restrictive range of
          foods. So, you will likely have other alternatives to choose from.
           Nevertheless, over the course of the 90 days, there will be LIVE
          coaching calls with a certified WILDFIT Coach.  Interestingly, because
          of the way WILDFIT is structured, some of our past students discovered
          that they had attributed the wrong type of food to their allergies and
          chronic inflammation. While we cannot guarantee this will be the case
          for you, WILDFIT will certainly help you gather plenty of insights and
          data on how certain foods can impact your unique body composition.
           Please let me know if you have any allergies prior to starting your
          journey for best success.
        </p>
        <p><b>WILL WILDFIT RECOMMEND ME TO TAKE SUPPLEMENTS?</b></p>
        <p>
          No, you do not need to take any additional supplements during the
          program or after the program has ended. WILDFIT is designed to create
          permanent change. This has been proven time and time again with our
          students who, after months of having completed WILDFIT, never regain the
          extra weight and remain at peak levels of health.  Our aim is for you to
          return to your healthiest state for good
        </p>
        <p><b>HOW SHOULD I PREPARE FOR THE WILDFIT PROGRAM?</b></p>
        <p>
          Don't. Don't change a thing until the program begins. You may be tempted
          to start making changes or improving your habits, but the WILDFIT
          program works best when you simply arrive as you are; not on best
          behaviour. For now, keep eating normally and don't change a thing.
