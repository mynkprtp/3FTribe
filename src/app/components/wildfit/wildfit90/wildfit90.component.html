      <div>
        WILDFIT 90 is a 90 day group coaching health transformation program that
        teaches you how to permanently alter your relationship with food. If you
        are someone who wants to release weight, gain or maintain weight, if you
        are an athlete seeking peak performance or someone who wants to live
        longer and with greater vitality, this is the place to be.

              We gain insights into why we eat, what we eat, when we eat it.

              ice-cream in the middle of the night!!

                Ever felt like a certain food has some kind of power over you ?
                Or a food that makes saying NO to it, next to impossible ? And
                have you ever realized that once you have those foods, do you
                feel guilty ? So if these foods are so good, why do they make
                you feel guilty ? Fair question, right ? So here is the thing,
                what has been described above isn't freedom. This is some kind
                of toxic relationship that we build with certain foods in the
                course of our lives that taste good but make you feel guilty or
                even cause physical discomfort (think about how you feel after
                eating a lot of sugar!). WILDFIT provides you with the tools to
                identify these toxic , non-functional food relationships and
                transform them into functional ones. The concept behind this is
                the behavioural change dynamics that help us break these
                non-functional relationships and build healthy habits that lasts
                a lifetime. At the end of 90 days, these are some of things my
                clients say :
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>"I no longer have any sugar cravings"</li>
                <li>
                  "Not sure why I liked eating ice cream so much, its GROSS!"
                </li>
                <li>"I do not feel any desire to eat processed foods."</li>
                <li>
                  "Vacations, family gatherings, social functions do not make me
                  nervous about my food choices!"
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                FOOD FREEDOM is all about being able to eat what you want,
                whenever you want, how much ever you want. And it ALSO means,
                being able to say NO to foods that you do not want to eat
                anymore. WILDFIT will help you reach a level of food freedom
                which is organic and does not require any willpower.

            <h3>FOOD FREEDOM</h3>
            <p>
              Ever felt like a certain food has some kind of power over you ? Or
              a food that makes saying NO to it, next to impossible ? And have
              you ever realized that once you have those foods, do you feel
              guilty ? So if these foods are so good, why do they make you feel
              guilty ? Fair question, right ?
