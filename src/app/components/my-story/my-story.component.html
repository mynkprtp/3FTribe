        For years, I struggled with weight and body image issues, fallen prey to
        many fad diets, spent thousands on personal trainers and nutritionists,
        lost and gained an upwards of 15 kgs multiple times in a decade. All the
        "dieting" completely messed my metabolism and even if I ate less food, I
        would put on weight. I remember being so puzzled thinking I must be
        "cursed". This led to all kinds of body image issues, I was never
        satisfied with the way I looked and never felt fully confident. I would
        lose some weight and start feeling good and then life would throw a
        curve ball and that’s it. I would lose all the momentum and find myself
        back at square one. I WAS TIRED.

        To add on this, I used to train a lot in the gym without fully
        understanding what would work best for my body. I was misled by all the
        fitness trends and it led to a knee injury that made me put things into
        perspective. In November 2019, the MRI report revealed that I had
        cartilage damage in my right knee. There was no remedy for this and I
        was asked to accept this to be my way of life. At this point, I wasn’t
        able to walk beyond 12000 steps without discomfort, wasn’t able to wear
        heels, wasn't able to go hiking, wasn’t able to do some of my favourite
        exercises. I WAS DEPRESSED.

        In 2020, COVID made things even worse, the level of physical activity
        reduced further and my weight started to climb. I was truly puzzled
        because I was following the very common concept of "everything in
        moderation" then why was I still putting on that much weight? I WAS
        CURIOUS My curiosity led me to do a deep dive into the world of
        nutrition and in February 2021, I started my very own WILDFIT journey!
        When I attended the Masterclass for WILDFIT with Eric Edmeades (Founder
        of WILDFIT), something struck me. It was unconventional. No one spoke
        about tracking calories, maintaining food diaries, exercising to death,
        haha!!! On the contrary, I heard for the first time about food
        psychology and how it governs the food decisions we make day in and day
        out. I WAS INTRIGUED. I was convinced that I need to give this a try and
        in March 2021, I had my very first session for WILDFIT. I had never
        experienced anything like this. The concepts, the information, the
        guidance and the sheer brilliance in which this program was constructed
        brought about fundamental changes in me in a matter of 90 days.
        <p>Here is a snapshot of my wins :</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Released 14kgs weight permanently!</li>

          <li>Recalibrated my sense of taste and smell</li>
          <li>Better skin and hair</li>
          <li>Energy levels were at an all-time high!</li>

        </ul>
        I vividly remember that day, when I was in week 7 of the challenge when
        I jogged painlessly for 20 mins, for the first time since 2019. My
        issues with the knee had disappeared and I WAS GRATEFUL!!
